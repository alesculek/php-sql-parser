# Where can I get PHP-SQL-Parser? #


GoogleCode does not support new downloads starting January 15th, 2014. You can find all old versions within the [Download section](http://code.google.com/p/php-sql-parser/downloads/list), but newer packages you will not find there. Currently we provide two alternatives:


## Google Drive ##

## Packagist ##

## GitHub ##
